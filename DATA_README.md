### WAI-practice BoT-IoT Data

The data subset we have opted to used can be accessed here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1k6ueNbGngPzELmbd9PHljzQk5gaa52gC?usp=sharing

Our subset is taking from the larger BoT-IoT dataset - https://ieee-dataport.org/documents/bot-iot-dataset - which consists of approximately 73 million records of simulated Normal traffic and BotNet attack traffic.

The attack traffic includes:

DDoS
DoS
Reconnaisance
Theft

We have selected a subset of about 3 million records to make the data easier to work with for the purpose of our small project. We took a different subset than that suggested in the original paper releasing the dataset
as we have opted to take all of the normal and instances since these are present in much smaller quantities.

The creation of the subset and the final statistics are given in the contained python notebook.
